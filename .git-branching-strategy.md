# Git Branching Strategy

## Main Branches
- `main` → Stable, production-ready code.
- `develop` → Latest development code. Merges from all feature/bugfix branches.

## Supporting Branches
- `feature/feature-name` → For new features
- `bugfix/short-desc` → For fixing bugs
- `hotfix/fix-name` → For urgent fixes directly to `main`

## Workflow
1. Checkout `develop` and pull latest changes: git checkout develop git pull origin develop

2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix: git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

3. Work, commit, and test locally.
4. Push to remote: git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name

5. Create a pull request into `develop` on GitHub.
6. After review, merge PR into `develop`.

## Deployment
- `develop` → merged into `main` when releasing to production.
